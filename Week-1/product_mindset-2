Design Thinking helps us to approch a problem in a better manner.

##Empathize
   1-They need safe pedestrian
   2-bike passage to go to and from work, to go to and from a public transportation stop nearby.
    3-perhaps people with disabilities who need extra room on their journey to navigate the space with strollers and wheelchairs.

##Define the problem
 Design or  mention rules to traffic intersectio for 
1-safe pedestrain
   -In India, the pedestrian fatality share has risen 84% over the last four years, with average daily fatalities going from 34 to 62 in 2018. In the United States, around 6,000 pedestrians were killed in road crashes in 2018
 so,safe pedestrain is defintely needed
2-bike passage 
3-bus stop
4-taking care for disability people(reduce walk time on raod)

##Ideate
-focus on problem statement
1-safe pedestrain
    -and provide space for pedestrians to move around, sit, shop, eat, meet and socialize. Recommended width is at least 1.5-1.8 meters (5-6 feet) for low-volume areas and 2.5 meters (8 feet) for high-volume areas.
   -Pedestrian plazas can inexpensively transform under-used spaces into community assets. Unstructured, under-occupied or misused dead zones can be revamped with the help of paint, planter boxes, artwork and street furniture, along with high-resistance and low-maintenance lighting and landscaping.
-Skid-proof pavements, high-visibility crosswalks, and wide and accessible sidewalks should make it easy for pedestrians to navigate. And traffic-calming infrastructure should be implemented to reduce vehicle speeds.
-Many countries were taking these to increase pedestrain safety
-ex-oslo -implemented Vision Zero, along with plans to become car-free and their investment in walkability, to reduce traffic-related injuries. By reducing the driving speed limit in cities, increasing parking charges and overall making it more difficult to drive a motorised vehicle in the cities
  
provided elderly and people with different abilities with more green light traffic time to allow them to safely cross busy roads.
Walking safely in our basic human need – it’s something every citizen of a well-managed and respected city requires and deserves. 

2-Bike safety
 -Give space for bike riders at least 1m space in low speed areas
-Give atleast  1.5m meter distance in higher speed areas. Littel bit of space for safety

3-Bus stops
  --Bus stops should normally be located not less than 30 meters from a main road junction, in order to minimize obstruction of turning traffic. On the other hand, if passengers are to connect with buses on intersecting routes, it’s desirable for buses to stop within easy walking distance of junctions. In residential developments where there are pedestrian routes that are separate from the road system, bus stops should be located where these intersect the roads used by buses.
    
4-For diiferent ability people
  -Allow Time for Crossing
  -Pedestrians cannot travel long distances as quickly as vehicles. And individuals with impairments may need more time to make a street crossing depending on their particular needs. Be considerate. Don’t honk your horn or rev your engine while waiting for pedestrians to cross.
  -construct an easy fly over  or underground roads to cross in juncitons
